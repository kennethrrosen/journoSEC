Understanding Threats to Your Digital Security (Threat Models)
=========================

The axiom of journalists is often "trust, but verify"; or, "if your mother says she loves you, check it out." For the purposes of  investigative journalism and conflict correspondence, we should take the "zero trust architecture" (ZTA) approach to our work.

These models and examples are meant to help you (very briefly) recognize threats before moving into implementation so that you're prepared to understand how each change seeks to address any gaps in the security of yourself, your sources, and your work. Ideally, over time, you'd find it natural (almost comfortable, if not intuitive) to make these practices second-nature for safer communication and reporting.

One final note: these measures can help prevent, at the very least mitigate, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from snooping your work, but these are not the finite methods to doing so. They are merely the foundation. The single-point of failure is always being human.

There are four major tiers of threat modelling, as described by Cupwire[^1]. The below summarize the scenarios regularly encountered by journalists and the requisite digital and operational security practices.

###### A Quick Note for Newsrooms and Journalists Who Rely on Google Workspace

This guide assumes you're forced to rely on Google Suite. Google is safe and getting better, but it's tracking processes are of great concern. Apple shows similar signs of faults that could compromise journalists. Meta has already shown an inability, or unwillingness, to protect those who use their platforms for reporting and communicating with sources. A large part of the threat modelling in this guide is prefaced on the assumption that you're moving to partition your work and personal lives.
