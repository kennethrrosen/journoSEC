Existing guides and infrastructure for journalists insuffiecently prepares them for interacting with sources, working on sensitive stories while protecting sensitive materials, and traveling cross borders with personal and professional data.

There are myriad good resources for online anonymity,[^1] online privacy,[^2] and circumventing authoritarian regime strangholds on internet restrictions.[^3] But the job of keeping a secure digital environment is a marathon, not a race,[^4] one which is difficult to maintain while operating in mass media structures reliant on poor digital security infrastructure and loose guidelines for digital health.

Most journalists do not fundamentally understand how networks associate with their technology. [^5] Not for a lack of care or concern. There is simply a choice to be made: get the story, or dwaddle learning Linux, coding, and the demands of jobs which often offer only tools distributed by the news or media organization.

Researchers have also concluded similar failings of existing tools for journalists not pirmarily because of usability and integration issues, but that they actively hinder reporting, most sources dictate how communication is handled, and not least of all financial and timing constraints. [^6]

Attacks on journalists and freedom of the press have increased markedly over the past several
years around the globe, according to a paper published by the UC Berkely Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, and a reason why "journalists do not take sufficient action to protect themselves online is that there is an overwhelming amount of security advice on the internet, most of which is difficult for journalist-readers to understand or translate into practice, and difficult for the authors of the advice to keep up to date."

The author, Kristen Berdan, continues:

>Most guides do not account for journalistsâ€™ busy schedules and time-pressured work cycles. Journalists also operate in an increasingly hostile environment, even in countries with democratic governments and some historical guarantees of freedom of the press and rule of law.

Berdan concludes advice available online "provide[s] no clear path for users to improve
their security in a time-efficient way."[^7]

This guide &mdash; which curates and streamlines the myriad vailable online sources to focus primarily on use by working investigative journalists, conflict reporters, and war correspondents &mdash; aims to help journalsts a) understand their threat model and b) assit in easily integrating security practices into their workflow, despite hurdles presented by company-proferred equipment and systems.

### ðŸŸ§ how to use this repository
1. Read the Wiki. Do this first. (Read time: ~30 minutes.)
2. Consider, then choose, your threat model. (Read time: ~15 minutes.)
3. Follow the threat model best-practices and assoicated guides (Implementation time: varies.)
* to journalists under threat of violence, surveillance or other immediate danger, I will provide free assistance in implementing your threat model mitigations

<b>Remember:</b> you can go as deep into digital and personal security as any internet rabbit hole. Take those steps which allow you to continue you work with a peace of mind, making you more aware of common pitfalls and adversareal tactics, and limit any distractions or obstacles to getting and publishing the story.
